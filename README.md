					           Stack & Queue Menu Driven Program

This is a menu-driven C++ program that implements a Stack and a Queue.
This program will read in some text from a file and extract numbers and punctuation from the text.

After the numbers and punctuation is extracted from the string, the string will be sent to either a stack 
or queue (choice is made by user).

After either data structure receives the text, it will store it in its linked list.

Once the program reaches the End of the File, the data structure will print out the items to a output file.
* If the queue is chosen, it will output the words, with the words length & the average word length in the file.
